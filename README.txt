VEIL

This is a steganography project I did in C awhile back.  I just started learning C# so I decided to port it over.

**Current Features

-Embed and recover any file into a lossless image file [file must be ~8 times smaller than the original image]
-PNG, BMP, TIF files supported for embedding
-LSB Steganography

**Example

This README file is embedded into StegImage.png.  The bitmap was read from OriginalImage.jpg.

**Future Features

-AES
-Lossy image files
-Audio and Video Steganography
-Steganalysis
-Password Generator
