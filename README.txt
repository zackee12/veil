VEIL

C# steganography/steganalysis/cryptography

- Current Features
	- Utilizes LSB steganography in lossless image formats to store files inside images (PNG, TIF)
	- Allows data to be split up into multiple files
	- Supports AES, Blowfish, DES, Mars, RC2, Rijndael, Serpent, TripleDES, and Twofish symmetric block ciphers

- Future Plans
	- Other forms of steganography (Echo, BPCS, 
	- Making hidden files more difficult to detect (like whitening)
	- Detection of hidden files (steganalysis)
	- Password generation
	- More block ciphers
	- Multi block ciphers encryption (AES - Twofish)
